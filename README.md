# FourierTransform
Signal split into separate frequencies
Pusrpose of this project is to replicate functionality shown in the video 3Blue1Brown about fourier transform.
1 st step will be creation of the flexible graphing tool.
2 nd step will be creation of the class that can manage graphs frequency, transforming signal into a function.
3 rd step will be analysing the signal and extracting frequencies fom it.
